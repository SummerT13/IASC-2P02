    <h1>Emma by Jane Austen</h1>
    <h2>Summmer Tibando</h2>

    <p>The text I have chosen to visualize for this assignment is a novel called Emma, written by Jane Austen. The book was published in three volumes and the time of publication was in 1815. The story is set in England during the early 19th century. It is about a girl named Emma, who is a young woman in the village of Highbury who considers herself to be an expert matchmaker. Even with the best of intentions, her meddling frequently causes confusion and difficulties in the lives of others around her. I selected the book "Emma" for my Data Visualization Assignment because it offers an abundance of material for critical examination due to its humor, complex social interactions, and well-developed characters. As a user you are able to rotate the 3D visualization to view it from different angles. Right to left, up and down, diagonally, etc.</p>

    <p>The first visualization is related to common objects used throughout the book. I have chosen items that appeal most to the theme of the novel. For instance, tea, book, and chair were picked. They are not only common objects throughout, but they are also three items that can work well together. For example, you sit in a chair and make a tea to drink while reading a book. As for the visualization, the information that can be translated is a visual depiction of where these objects are used. Looking at the data we can see that “tea” and “chair” is used well throughout the whole novel from start to finish, but “book” is only becoming more prevalent towards the end of the novel. “Tea” is mentioned first before “chair” and “book” are mentioned. “Tea” is also the most common object while “book” is the least common. Based on how frequently or how relevantly an object occurs in the text, it is placed in a specific space. Cubes that are grouped together, for instance, indicate scenarios in which those elements are used the most. Insight 1: Certain home items' abundance or scarcity in various scenarios reflect the characters' social and economic standing or way of life throughout the novel. Insight 2: Distribution patterns of objects may draw attention to recurrent themes or motifs in the story, including social gatherings or domesticity that include the following objects such as the chair, the tea, and the books.</p>

    <p>Three ways in which the second visualization is substantially different from the first visualization is distinguishing how character interactions are the main focus of the second visualization, while inanimate objects are the main focus of the first. Another way they are different is by examining how there is a difference between characters and objects, as they have different visual cues and markers in the two representations. Lastly, both visualizations offer a unique set of insights that speak to a distinct part of the story. As a user, you are able to rotate the 3D visualization to view from different angles. Right to left, up and down, diagonally, etc. Selecting and unselecting certain words will give you a better depiction of an individual word’s usage itself. You can also select the animation box to watch the bubbles come to life and become more interactive text. </p>

    <p>The second visualization is interpreting the main characters throughout the novel. When you first look at the visualization without making any changes, you can see that it looks very clustered together and often seems overwhelming. When deselecting characters names to look at each individually, we can see that Emma is the most popular. Mr. Knightley is slightly a little less popular, and Mr. Churchill is the least popular. We can interpret from the information that Emma is the main character. Mr. Knightley is not a protagonist because he is mentioned just as much as Emma, and is mentioned throughout the whole novel, as shown in the visualization. Lastly, we can takeaway that Mr. Churchill is a protagonist in the novel because he is mentioned more at the beginning of the novel, but he also appears a little in the middle and towards the end. Overall, this data visualization interprets how often each character is mentioned through the beginning to the end of the novel and how important they are to the story’s narrative. Characters are spatially represented according to how they appear in the text. Spheres that are close to one another may have relationships or conflicts. Insight 1: Finding antagonistic character clusters in particular scenes help to identify key points of tension or conflict in the story. For example, out of the three characters Mr. Frank Churchill is the only antagonist and shows where there is conflict in the novel. Insight 2: Examining the spatial arrangements of protagonists and antagonists provide valuable understanding of power dynamics and motivations of each individual character as seen in the visualization.</p>

        <h2>Characters Importance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li id="pink">Emma</li>
            <li id="aqua">Mr. Knightley</li>
            <li id="purple">Mr. Churchill</li>
        </ul>
        <canvas class="webgl2"></canvas>
        <p>Left click and drag to rotate. Right click and drag to move. Scroll to zoom.</p>
        <div id ="parent2"></div>
     </div>

    <p>To conclude, both visualizations were used to depict a certain narrative in the story. Visualization one was objects, and visualization two was characters. My overall analysis has found that characters are more important and are mentioned more than objects. I used cubes to depict objects because objects are often sharp, and cubes have sharper definition. I used spheres to represent characters because they have a softer appeal when referring to a person rather than an object. When the bubbles are animated, we can see the visualization slit into two. I chose to use the splitting method to demonstrate that when the story is split into two you can see how important Emma and Mr. Knightly are since there are no gaps. Although, when only Mr. Churchills name is selected, we can see a gap where he doesn’t appear between the middle and end of the story. This assignment helped me learn more about my readings and how to group the information visually so that I had a better idea of each character and object when relating it to the narrative if the story. I was also able to grasp a better understanding of the design vocab discussed in class, as I was able to put organization, proximity/distance, on top/below, and perspective into action.  </p>
