        <h2>1 Flatness</h2>

        <p> The people of the cave sit by the mysterious shadow displayed on the wall in front of them. The only source of light entering the cave comes from a small gab divided by the cave’s rocks. For those who sit still in the cave, these shadows which move and only appear when the sun is shinning in sun, the peoples only response to these items passing by the entrance are their one link to the outside world. For them, the darkness represents existence and a new language spoken only by higher powers. Sometimes, when glancing at the wall, the shadows have a life of their own and are a representation of a gift from nature. Sometimes a shadow will suddenly lengthen or shorter, as though it were expanding. Seeing this occurrence, the people in the cave interpret it as a message given to them. When analysing they can start to create a message that involves a “target”, as the shadow moves in two round shaped figures (target and target ring). They have convinced themselves that this is a link to what is beyond the cave and are amazed at the sight and place a significance into each subtle movement of the shadow. They interpret that the target is a symbolization of that they are where they are supposed to be. The target is a representation of how the people in the cave come together to support, reassure, and care for one another during their time with each other in this specific location (the cave). Although they don’t know that it is just a target on the outer side of the cave where the people on the outer side are throwing the ring onto the rounded target to see who can win the game, the rounded shaped shadows have provided them with a greater sense of hope. <span class="clickable" id="first-change">First Change</span></p>

        <p> The term "flatness," introduced by Nick Sousanis, describes a situation in which layers, viewpoints, and dimensions are reduced or compacted. Therefore, the people in the cave see moving objects as simple and plain. To my understanding, the term "flatness" refers to a surface level perspective of reality in which everything is understood without regard for the layers of complexity or meaning that lie under the surface. Flatness comes with no dimension and with no dimension comes no true understanding for thoughts or feelings on what an object is truly capable of doing. The people of the cave are a representation of individuals that have a flat worldview since their perception of reality is confined to the shadows that are projected onto the wall. They often overlook the reality outside of their local awareness, viewing these shadows as the entirety of existence even though there is more beyond them and a life outside of the cave. Their lack of awareness gives them the opportunity though to create their own interpretations on what different objects mean to me and what is different in existence outside the cave. As a result, by accepting a limited understanding of reality based only on what they can directly see and understand, the people of the cave represent Flatness due to how they perceive and live their everyday life. Even though the outside world can see the color, shape, size, and depth of the target as they play the game, those in the cave only understand that it is a rounded shaped object given to make their own interpretation out of. <span class="clickable" id="second-change">Second Change</span></p>

        <h2>2 Seeing Double</h2>

        <p> The scene that I have created is telling the story of a vibrant red, circle shaped target that is floating. I have represented that the people in the caves everyday life evolves around their interpretation of what they see on their cave wall, while we can see the full object in its true color and size without interpretation from the outside if the cave. The sun rises and sets, but as it does the shadow on the wall changes with it since the sun is the only light source available to create the shadow. The sun and the target work together as the sun shines through the targets round opening, separating the ring and the target, to display its shape on the cave wall as well as bring the pattern to life. The rounded objects move across the uneven stone wall captivating an exciting scene. The rays are how the people in cave can view this continually shifting shadow display of the target with every movement and arrangement that it forms from natures source of light. The changes I have made include making the virtical moving of the ring and the spinning moving of the ring. This is supposed to interpret how in a game of ring toss the person throws the ring through the air trying to toss onto the target. I think started to made the sphere target move as another change to make the game more challenging in terms of now the target is not just sitting still and the player has to plan to throw the ring onto the target while it is also moving. <span class="clickable" id="third-change">Third Change</span></p>

        <p> Seeing Double is accepting the diversity of perspectives that exist both within and outside of our immediate awareness, while overcoming a single point view. Over the course of the day, a dynamic scene plays outside the cave. After rising high in the sky, the sun starts to sit still, creating long shadows that make sit on the cave wall. The shadows move up the wall, changing in size and location as the sun sets. When the sun is setting and rising at specific times of the day, the target changes at the same time, the ring moves off the wall which the people can interpret as the ring in the game missed the target that was being aimed for. This leaves patterns across the cave wall, adding more room for imagination. There is a significant difference in the worldviews of those within and outside the cave. Those outside the cave observe the targets color and real time size, while the cave people see simply the shadows cast onto the wall and are left to interpret their own messages. In this case the real meaning that I would like to be interpreted is that the ring missed the target after being tossed by the player and is left laying on the ground waiting to be picked up for the next round. Those on the outside have a wider view, understanding how different factors interact to the shape the target that they are observing. Combining the two perspectives allows us to understand a deeper reality. This would be that light and shadows are natures process that change the scene on the wall. </p>
